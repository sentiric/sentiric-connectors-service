# Sentiric Connectors Service

**Description:** Provides specific API adapters or microservices for integrating Sentiric with various external business systems (e.g., CRM, ERP, Help Desk, E-commerce platforms). This can act as a hub for multiple individual connectors.

**Core Responsibilities:**
*   Managing authentication and interaction with specific external system APIs.
*   Fetching data from external systems and translating it into Sentiric's internal data model.
*   Relaying requests from Sentiric (e.g., "update customer information") to external systems.
*   If containing multiple connectors, routing requests to the appropriate internal connector logic.

**Technologies:**
*   Python (or Node.js, Java)
*   Flask/FastAPI/Express/Spring Boot (for internal APIs)
*   SDKs and clients for various external APIs (e.g., Salesforce, Zendesk, Shopify).

**API Interactions (As an Internal API Provider):**
*   Exposes internal APIs for `sentiric-agent-service` (to trigger business logic), and `sentiric-knowledge-service` (to pull data).
*   Consumes external APIs (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.).

**Local Development:**
1.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/sentiric/sentiric-connectors-service.git`
2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd sentiric-connectors-service`
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Python) or `npm install` (Node.js).
4.  Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` to configure credentials for external systems.
5.  Start the service: `python app.py` (or equivalent).

**Configuration:**
Refer to `config/` directory and `.env.example` for service-specific configurations, including external system API keys and integration settings.

**Deployment:**
Designed for containerized deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). Individual connectors within this service (or as separate microservices) can be scaled independently. Refer to `sentiric-infrastructure`.
